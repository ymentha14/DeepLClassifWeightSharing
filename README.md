#DeepLClassifWeightSharing
The present repository aims at presenting (yet another..) MNIST classification method, but tries to avoid state of the art pretrained models and ratherimplement the following features, as a deepL challenge and in order to assess whether Genetic Algorithm perform as well as GridSearch on a toy dataset.

* Weight sharing
* Genetic Algorithm
* Grid Search
